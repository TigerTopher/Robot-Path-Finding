* This file is formatted using a markdown language.

## Important Notes:
* Input is found in input.txt . Be sure to create it or else the program won't run. Below is an example of an input.txt file.
```
(0,0)
(199,399)
(0,0),(10,0),(10,5),(5,10),(0,5)
(50,50),(50, 60),(60,60),(60,50)
```
* Polygons as input is assumed to be simple polygons only, not complex polygons.

* For old C compilers. compile C file using command `$ gcc main.c -lm -o main.exe`. This includes `#include<math.h>` library. This is needed since I used its floor and ceiling function.

* Size is assumed to be 200x400.

* Just change `#define` values to change size and more.
